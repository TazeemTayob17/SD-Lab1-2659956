                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>
                    For my latest project, i created an AI agent of a snake game using Djikstra ALgorithm.
                    My snake needed to use the algorithm to find the shortest path to eat an apple in order to grow, and dodge enemy and zombie snakes as well.
                    We were put on the leaderboard and matched up against others in the class and my snake finished in the top 20.
